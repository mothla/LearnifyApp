## The Idea of This Application
The application is a machine learning-based platform designed to facilitate learning on Udemy by providing personalized course recommendations tailored to each user's interests. Through a thoughtfully crafted user interface and seamless user experience, our app harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to analyze user preferences, behaviors, and interests. By understanding these factors, the app suggests relevant and engaging courses from Udemy's extensive library.
